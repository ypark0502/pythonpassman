# Python Password Manager
* This application uses the getpass and hashlib libraries to implement a basic command line password manager.
* The user can either create an account or login to an existing account.
* The getpass getpass() function enables the user to enter a password without it being seen.
* The hashlib library hashes the password using the sha256 algorithm.
* The username and password are stored in a dictionary as a key value pair.
